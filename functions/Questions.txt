1-  create a simple calculator in Python. The calculator should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Here are the detailed requirements:

Implement a function add(x, y) that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

Implement a function subtract(x, y) that takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.

Implement a function multiply(x, y) that takes two numbers as input and returns their product.

Implement a function divide(x, y) that takes two numbers as input and returns their quotient. Ensure that the function handles the case of division by zero appropriately.

Create a main function called calculator() that interacts with the user to perform calculations. The main function should:

Display a menu with options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Prompt the user to enter their choice and the numbers on which the operation should be performed.
Call the corresponding function based on the user's choice and display the result.
Ensure the program continues to run until the user chooses to exit.

Feel free to add additional features or improvements to enhance the calculator's functionality. Test your program with various input scenarios to ensure it works correctly. 

2- write a Python function which takes a positive number as input and return the factorial of the number.

eg: factorial of 5 is -> 5*4*3*2*1 = 120

3- Write a Python function that accepts a string and counts the number of upper and lower case letters.
Sample String : 'The quick Brow Fox'
Expected Output :
No. of Upper case characters : 3
No. of Lower case Characters : 12

4- Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with distinct elements from the first list.
Sample List : [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

5- Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is a palindrome or not.
Note: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam.

6- Write a Python function that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Sample Items : green-red-yellow-black-white
Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow

7- write a python function that accepts a string and prints the count of occurence of each characters
sample string: aabccda
expected result:
a -> 3
b-> 1
c-> 2
d -> 1

8- write a function called is_prime that takes an integer as an argument and returns True if it is a prime number, and False otherwise.

9- write a function called generate_fibonacci that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.

10- Write a function called capitalize_odd_letters that takes a string as input and returns the same string with the odd-indexed letters capitalized.
eg: input : ankit . output : aNkIt

11- write a function called find_common_elements that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the common elements between the two lists.
