use orders.txt dataset for below problems
the dataset has more number of rows and in notebook it show only few of them. run below commands to change the settings:
pd.set_option('display.min_rows', 500)  
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 500)


1- write a program to fetch all the orders with indexes  multiple of 100 eg : 100,200,300,400..... . Display order_id , category and sales columns
2- write a program to find all orders in furniture category with sales amount between 1000 and 1200
3- write a program to find all the orders where there was a loss (profit<0) in the city of new york , Los Angeles and Seattle
4- create a new column in the orders dataframe with name profit_flag. Set its value as 1 if profit is greater than 0 else set 0.
5- a)in the orders data frame rename column names to upper case ..eg order_id should be ORDER_ID
   b)again change the column names back to lower case
6- set the index of orders dataframe to order_id and fetch order details(all columns) of following list of orders : 
CA-2019-115742
CA-2020-111682
CA-2019-149587
US-2020-150147
CA-2020-138520

7- for the previous question display columns order id, order date , sales and category columns in the given order

8- for the previous(6th) question display all the columns from order_date to city (as per the order in dataset)

9- sort the index (order id) in descending order for the dataframe 

10- write the result of previous question into a csv file in your local machine

11- sort the dataframe column by profit in descending order 

12- sort the dataframe column by sales in ascending order , in case of a tie it should be sorted by profit in descending order 

13- reset the index to original state

14- create a column as profit_category . sets it value as below:

if profit < 0 then 'loss'
if profit between 0 and 100 then 'low profit' 
if profit between 100 and 500 then 'medium profit'
else high profit 

15- create a new column sales_profit_ratio and set its value as (profit/sales)*100
